            <h2>Staging &amp; Preparation</h2>
            <h3>The Investment is always less than the first price reduction</h3>
            <p>A pristine, neutrally decorated home with broad appeal will typically sell faster, and for more money. You can't change your size or location, so your home should be as current and well maintained as possible. Think of it like this, if your home was a hotel, and your bathrooms were the spa, would visitors stay and pay a premium price, or would they walk out and go elsewhere? Before any marketing begins we'll start with a walk through with a staging and styling consultation specialist. We will help maximize your home's appeal for the photos and beyond.

If you want to give yourself every opportunity to get a premium result, then you have to start with the one thing that impacts almost everything else in your marketing campaign - the photography of your home. Orr photographers are skilled and vetted for their ability in architectural real estate photography and trained to capture key, value building elements. *According to a study by Redfin, Listings shot with DSLR cameras sell for $5743 more in $400k-$499k price bracket.</p>

But we don't stop there, our listing syndication puts your property on 1,000's of websites and when it's 11:40pm... 1,000's of sites are working hard for you even while you sleep.</p>
