  <p>Whether you are buying your very first home or selling your 8th revenue property, you deserve solid representation, honest advice, current and relevant data and solid guidance. You can not make an informed decision without the proper information from an advisor you can trust and rely on.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Hi, my name is Chris Audette. Our mandate is to provide you with all the current, relevant and factual information so you can make an informed decision. My personal mandate, is to provide my clients a better <a href="https://www.calgary-real-estate.com/marketing.php">marketing package</a> than they can get anywhere else in Calgary.</p>
  <p>I have been a licensed Realtor and Associate Broker since 2009. In 2017, I founded The Group at Re/Max First. With its focus on solidly representation of its valued clients, by its second year in&nbsp;2018 The Group achieved top production rankings in the Re/Max system within Calgary (#2), Alberta (#2), Western Canada (#9) and Nationally (#48). With over 2,000 transactions and $1Billion dollars in sales completed, we have the experience you need. <strong>Why should you care?</strong> The average agent completes 5 transactions per year, and expertise matters, and expertise comes with the combination of experience and, learning and focus on doing a better job for everybody involved.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>We are a process and tool based team of Calgary realtors&reg;. We&rsquo;ve helped over 1600 families successfully sell for top dollar and confidently buy up into the right new home. And we operate out of the number 1 Remax office in the world. We believe in giving back. For the last few years, I have been one of the top contributing individuals to the childrens miracle network in Canada (and so has my brokerage) I am proud to be able to make the claim, that each and every one of the agents on this team puts teh clients needs of the utmost importance and competently guides buyers and sellers through this complex process. But don't take my word for it, read the reviews below and talk directly with one of our agents today.</p>
